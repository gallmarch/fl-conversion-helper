# Fallen London Conversion Helper

An unofficial extension for [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/) that displays the convertible items in your inventory, organised by tier and side-conversion chain.

This extension adds three new categories to the top of the Inventory section of the 'Myself' tab: 'Tier 1', 'Tier 2', and 'Tier 3'.
Each category contains the convertible items you own in that tier,
arranged by each item's category's place in the Tier 3 side-conversion chain (starting with Academic).

Each category is initially collapsed; you can expand it by clicking the '+' icon. Missing items in each tier are indicated
by an empty slot. If you don't have enough of an item to mass-convert it, its icon is disabled.

You can choose which categories to show by clicking the extension's icon beside the address bar.
