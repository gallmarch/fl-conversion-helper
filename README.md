# Fallen London Conversion Helper

An unofficial extension for [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/) that makes converting certain kinds of items easier.

This extension adds some new sections to the top of the Inventory section of the 'Myself' tab: one each for tiers 1â€“4, and one for faction-related items. They're collapsed by default, but you can click to expand them. (You can choose which sections to show and hide in your preferences.)

Each 'Tier X' section contains the convertible items you own in that tier,
arranged by each item's category's place in the Tier 3 side-conversion chain (starting with Academic, and ending with Rumour). Missing items in each section are indicated by an empty slot.
By default, an item's icon is disabled (greyed-out) if you don't have enough of it to perform the (slightly-profitable) mass-conversion action. (You can change this in your preferences.)

The Faction Items section contains any of the items you own that are connected to the factions in the game that use Favours and Renown. The quantity indicator on the icon shows how many of that faction's Favours you have. By default, if you don't have enough Favours to convert into Renown with that faction, the item is disabled.

Missing items in each section are indicated by an empty slot. By default, if you don't have enough of an item to mass-convert it, its icon is disabled.

## Options

There are a few ways in which you can change the extension's behaviour, available on the extension's popup menu.

You can hide sections completely by editing the options in the popup menu, reached by clicking the extension's icon beside the address bar.

You can also change when items are enabled or disabled.
By default, each item in a tier is only enabled if you have enough to perform the (slightly profitable) mass conversion action. You can change this so that each tiered item is enabled if you can perform the smaller conversion action, or so that tiered items are always enabled.

Similarly, you can change the default behaviour of faction items, so that they're always enabled. This might be useful if you want to change your Quirks.
